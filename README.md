# supportvectormechanism
## project title
Using the support vector mechanism algorithm of supervice machine learning,predict iris.csv data set to find out the spicece will same or diiferent.
## task 
1. preprocess the data in skit learn librarie 
2. load the data using sk learn model selection default argument
3. on the bases of the data train_test_split your svm model
4. implement support vector mechanism classifier svm_classifier.the must be "Linear"
5. train the classifier on the training the data 
6. find out the prediction value on the test_data
7. test the model with help of acuuracy,accuracy should be lie in the range of 0-1

## conclusion
according to my support vector mechanism model the spicece are linear.with the accuracy of 1.00. Hence proved model was successfully implemented
